// Linked list are kind the same as ArrayList
//Class ArrayList is resizable-array implementations of List
//Inserting an element between exisisting elements of an ArrayList is an inefficient operation
// A LinkedList enables efficient insertion ( or removeal ) of elements in the middle of a collection,
// but it is much less efficient than an ArrayList for jumping to a specific element in the collection
// (random access)
 // the underlying structure is a linked data structure
 // it can be defined and used similar to ArrayList :

 LinkedList<Type> name =


 // Linked data structures

 // all the collections we will use and implement in this course use one eof the following two underlying data structure:
 // an array of elements


 // Reference vs objects

 Variable = value;




// Linked node question

//Algorithm pseudocode
